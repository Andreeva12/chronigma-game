# Performance Report - Session 1 (Keyboard/Mouse)

**Date:** 2024-01-22
**Session Duration:** ~90 minutes
**Hardware:** ROG Zephyrus G16 (i9-13900H, NVIDIA GeForce RTX)
**Settings:** Presumed default/auto (1080p, High settings)

**Data Source:** `Logs/NVIDIA_App_Performance_Log_2026-01-22T19-00-58.csv`

**Summary:**
Performance is generally stable and smooth for a puzzle game. No critical performance issues observed.

**Key Metrics:**
*   **Average FPS:** ~59.5 FPS (capped at monitor refresh, indicative of stable performance).
*   **Frame Time / Render Latency:** ~1.3 ms (Excellent).
*   **CPU Utilization:** ~22% (Low, as expected).
*   **GPU Utilization:** ~41% (Moderate, game is not graphically demanding).
*   **Temperatures:** GPU at 36°C (Cool).

**Analysis:**
The game runs efficiently without pushing the hardware to its limits. The stable 59.5 FPS suggests a near-perfect lock to 60 FPS with minimal stuttering. Latency metrics from the companion log (`NVIDIA_App_Latency_Log_...`) are required for full input latency analysis, but render latency is excellent.

**Conclusion:**
No performance-related bugs identified. The game is well-optimized for mid-to-high-end hardware.
